# New in Version v2.2.0 #
ROI spectrum fitting added to Image Analyzer
Performance improvements for auto_wizard
Sample re-calibration is now possible via the Re-Configuration Panel

Fixed issues:
- Pre-v1.3 datacubes unable to use auto_wizard (fixed)
- AdvCalib sometimes would pick an out-of-bounds mca (fixed)
- Attempting to save a datacube while another one was loaded could cause the cube to save in the wrong path (fixed)
- Replacing images in cube when a different cube was loaded replaces the image
in the last loaded cube instead (fixed)
